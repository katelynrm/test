"""
Prints the temperatures of different temperature classes based on FMI observations from Helsinki Malmi airport station.

Description:
    This script is only a test for a planned version that would read in temperature
    information from a file and allow users to analyze hourly-based temperature observations 
    in the FMI network. 

Note:
    The data has been aggregated from hourly based data into a night-time, day-time and evening time average 
    temperatures. 

Limitations:
    This code will not work if the temperatures are not classified, and the information in Task 3
    are not solved.

Usage:
    ./classify_temperatures.py

# Task 1 - Create empty lists for different temperature classes
# i.e. cold, slippery, comfortable, warm
# -------------------------------------------------------------

cold = []
slippery = []
comfortable = []
warm = []

# Task 2 - Iterate over temperatures and add temperatures to different temperature classes
# as defined below:
#  1. Cold --> temperatures below -2 degrees (Celsius)
#  2. Slippery --> temperatures between -2 and +2 degrees (Celsius)
#  3. Comfortable --> temperatures between +2 and +15 degrees (Celsius)
#  4. Warm --> temperatures above +15 degrees (Celsius)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Add your code here. 


# Task 3 - Questions - Print the answers
# --------------------------------------

# 1. How many times was it slippery during the study period?

# Edit these variable (i.e. replace XXX) by finding out how many values are withing different lists
slippery_times = XXX
print("In April 2013 it was slippery ", slippery_times, "times.")

# 2. How many times was it warm?

# 3. How many times was it cold?
cold_times = XXX
print("In April 2013 it was cold ", cold_times, "times.")



# Task 4 - EXTRA (optional)
# --------------------------

# Data values in the 'temperatures' list are grouped in a way that three values always comprise
# a single day. I.e. 
# The first value in the list is temperature for night-time (00-08) at day 1, 
# the second for day-time (08-16) at day 1, 
# and the third for evening (16-24) temperatures at day 1,
# whereas the fourth value is temperature for night-time (00-08) on the next day (day 2), etc.

# 1. Create empty lists for night, day, and evening temperatures

# Add your code here

# 2. Iterate over the temperature values and add the temperatures to corresponding lists

# Add your code here

# 3. What was the mean day-time temperature in April 2013?

# Add your code here that answers to the question
mean_temperature = None
